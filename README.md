2) From your terminal, navigate to the mealp folder.  
3) From your terminal, type:
    - bundle install 
    - rake db:migrate
    - rails s 
4) From your web browswer:
    - navigate to your localhost server
    - in localhost type /users/new to create an account
    - you must make a new post BEFORE navigating the site

5) Enjoy :)
